## About Me!
Hi! My name is Lauren Hallameyer!
<Body> X0 I am currently working at Home Depot while I try to finish up my Masters in Library science! 
._. I would love collaborating on anything to do with coding, it frustrates and confuses me to the point of tears. 
:P Ask me anything about video games, I adore playing them whenever I get the chance!
Pronouns are, she/her or they/them!
:O Fun fact about me! I have been to 37 different states but never stepped out of the US. </body>
